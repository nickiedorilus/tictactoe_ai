# Unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe AI  
### Using Minimax + Alpha-Beta Pruning

This project implements a Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python where the human player competes against an **unbeatable AI opponent**.  
The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm** with **Alpha-Beta Pruning** to always make the optimal move.

## How It Works
- The game board is represented as a list of 9 positions.
- Minimax explores all possible game states to choose the best move.
- Alpha-Beta pruning improves performance by cutting off unnecessary branches.
- The AI will **never lose** it either wins or forces a draw.
